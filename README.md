# Crypto-Candles
Hello there!

I have created a script that fetches data using Kucoin API. 
Due to it's limitations it takes a little longer to generate a file then I would like to, so feel free to submit a pull request if you know how to improve it.

If you want to use it, just open the file and input start and end date. 
Choose the crypto (you can use every available pair from Kucoin) and pick the interval (1min, 3min, 5min, 15min, 30min, 1hour, 2hour, 4hour, 6hour, 8hour, 12hour, 1day, 1week).
Then, just wait for it to finish.



It is not very complicated, but maybe it will save you some time.
